# LED Blinking (No soldering required)
Sample source code for DIY PR1A. Project description : LED blinking is the simplest PIC microcontroller project. With just 3 simple steps, you can make the LEDs blinking by using the PIC16F84A. We strongly believe that this project is a very good kick-start to learn about programming microcontroller for the beginners.Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler, MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82/v9.80 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code C(PR1_1, PR1_2 and PR1_3), Sample code using MPLABX(PR1_1, PR1_2 and PR1_3) and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry.
